        Rock, Paper, Scissors is an easy, fast game that everyone probably already knows.
        But if you are new into this, down below you can find basic instructions on how to play it. 

        In rock-paper-scissors, two players will each randomly choose one of three  signs: rock, paper, scissors
        Here are the rules that determine which sign beats another:

        -Rock wins over scissors (because rock smashes scissors)
        -Scissors wins over paper (because scissors cut paper)
        -Paper wins over rock (because paper covers rock)

        If both players show the same sign, itâ€™s a tie.

        Good luck and enjoy your game game!
