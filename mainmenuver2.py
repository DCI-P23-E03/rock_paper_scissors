But if you are new into this, down below you can find basic instructions on how to play it. 

In rock-paper-scissors, two players will each randomly choose one of three  signs: rock, paper, scissors
Here are the rules that determine which sign beats another:

-Rock wins over scissors (because rock smashes scissors)
-Scissors wins over paper (because scissors cut paper)
-Paper wins over rock (because paper covers rock)

If both players show the same sign, itâ€™s a tie/draw.

Good luck and enjoy your game !
